<h1>HOPE</h1>

<sup>You may not always have a comfortable life,
 and you will not always be able to solve all of the world’s
 problems at once, but don’t ever underestimate the importance you can have.
 Because history has shown us that courage can be contagious,
 and hope can take on a life of its own</sup>
